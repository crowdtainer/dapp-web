# WalletConnect Bridge Server

Self-hosting bridge server for relaying WalletConnect connections in Crowdtainer.

As the time of this writting, WalletConnect (the company behind the 'walletconnect protocol') does not provide any supported open source backend implementation of their protocol (what they run in their API's is closed source, and what used to be available as open source is no longer maintained by them).

Therefore this folder provides the needed code for self-hosting a bridge server, forked from the last version available (v1), but with dependencies updated and any modifications needed to make the service functional.

Since this service is very simple/small, it is kept in this repository for the time being.
