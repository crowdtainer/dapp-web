           "description": "In the diverse department of Nariño, in the south west of Colombia, bordering Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean, there is a municipality named Consacá. In the vereda (or township) of La Aguada, Jesús Ignacio Paredes cultivates approximately one hectare made up of three separate plots named La Esperanza. <br /><br />Jesús Ignacio's daily life looks a bit different as we can imagine. The farm where he cultivates coffee is within a 20 minute walking distance from the place he lives. So he walks to the three plots of land, where his parents taught him everything he needs to know to be a successful producer, where his beloved Castillo and Colombia varietals grow, protected with a shade from other trees like plantain and citrus fruit trees. The crops grow at 1900 m.a.s.l. and he makes sure they are cared for.",
